The FilmSystemetClient project aimed to seamlessly integrate a powerful backend with a user-friendly frontend. Building upon a RESTful API developed in a previous project, I enhanced functionality by incorporating TMDB (The Movie Database) API for dynamic retrieval of movie metadata such as posters and descriptions. Complementing this backend, a sleek React.js frontend interface was crafted to provide users with an intuitive platform for interacting with the system, resulting in a seamless movie client experience.
